# Gaussian/Median Noise FIltering with OpenCV
## Overview
This script demonstrates various image processing techniques in Python using OpenCV and Matplotlib within Google Colab. It includes image upload, noise addition, and various filtering methods.

## Requirements
- OpenCV (cv2)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Features
1. **Image Upload**: Uploads an image file to Colab.
2. **Noise Addition**: Adds artificial noise to the image.
3. **Filtering**: Implements mean, median, Gaussian filtering, and sharpening.
4. **Visualization**: Displays the original and processed images.
5. **Normal Distribution Plot**: Plots a scatter plot of a normal distribution.

## Usage
Run the script in a Google Colab notebook. The script includes:
- Uploading an image file.
- Converting the uploaded image for processing.
- Adding noise and applying filters.
- Visualizing results and the normal distribution.

## Note
The upload widget only works in an active Colab session. Ensure the cell is executed in the current browser session for uploading files.
